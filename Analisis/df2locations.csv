1,Portugal,"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.",87,15.0,Roger Voss,Portuguese Red,Quinta dos Avidagos,2011,Douro,-5.1252011,41.453397
4,US,"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.",87,65.0,Paul Gregutt,Pinot Noir,Sweet Cheeks,2012,Willamette Valley,-122.6670374,45.3442868
5,Spain,"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.",87,15.0,Michael Schachner,Tempranillo-Merlot,Tandem,2011,Navarra,-1.830787673361753,42.61254875
7,France,"This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion. Balanced with acidity and a firm texture, it's very much for food.",87,24.0,Roger Voss,Gewürztraminer,Trimbach,2012,Alsace,7.4074699518555,48.24917645
9,France,This has great depth of flavor with its fresh apple and pear fruits and touch of spice. It's off dry while balanced with acidity and a crisp texture. Drink now.,87,27.0,Roger Voss,Pinot Gris,Jean-Baptiste Adam,2012,Alsace,7.4074699518555,48.24917645
10,US,"Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot. Coffee and chocolate complete the picture, finishing strong at the end, resulting in a value-priced wine of attractive flavor and immediate accessibility.",87,19.0,Virginie Boone,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kirkland Signature,2011,Napa Valley,113.98039316440286,22.41124455
11,France,"This is a dry wine, very spicy, with a tight, taut texture and strongly mineral character layered with citrus as well as pepper. It's a food wine with its almost crisp aftertaste.",87,30.0,Roger Voss,Gewürztraminer,Leon Beyer,2012,Alsace,7.4074699518555,48.24917645
12,US,"Slightly reduced, this wine offers a chalky, tannic backbone to an otherwise juicy explosion of rich black cherry, the whole accented throughout by firm oak and cigar box.",87,34.0,Virginie Boone,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini,2012,Alexander Valley,-122.8278697,38.6712308
13,Italy,"This is dominated by oak and oak-driven aromas that include roasted coffee bean, espresso, coconut and vanilla that carry over to the palate, together with plum and chocolate. Astringent, drying tannins give it a rather abrupt finish.",87,,Kerin O’Keefe,Nerello Mascalese,Masseria Setteporte,2012,Etna,14.9940321,37.7510251
14,US,"Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple. In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive.",87,12.0,Matt Kettmann,Chardonnay,Mirassou,2012,Central Coast,151.312067495083,-33.3117096
16,Argentina,"Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. A compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance.",87,30.0,Michael Schachner,Malbec,Felix Lavaque,2010,Cafayate,-65.9800655,-26.071047
17,Argentina,"Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. This has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. A flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot.",87,13.0,Michael Schachner,Malbec,Gaucho Andino,2011,Mendoza,-68.43818677312292,-34.787093049999996
18,Spain,"Desiccated blackberry, leather, charred wood and mint aromas carry the nose on this full-bodied, tannic, heavily oaked Tinto Fino. Flavors of clove and woodspice sit on top of blackberry fruit, then hickory and other forceful oak-based aromas rise up and dominate the finish.",87,28.0,Michael Schachner,Tempranillo Blend,Pradorey,2010,Ribera del Duero,-3.726459680944383,41.675622000000004
19,US,"Red fruit aromas pervade on the nose, with cigar box and menthol notes riding in the back. The palate is slightly restrained on entry, but opens up to riper notes of cherry and plum specked with crushed pepper. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is approachable now and ready to be enjoyed.",87,32.0,Alexander Peartree,Meritage,Quiévremont,2012,Virginia,-78.4927721,37.1232245
20,US,"Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco. The palate is oak-driven in nature, but notes of tart red currant shine through, offering a bit of levity.",87,23.0,Alexander Peartree,Red Blend,Quiévremont,2012,Virginia,-78.4927721,37.1232245

23,US,"This wine from the Geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose. The flavors are a bit flat at first, then the acidity and tension of sour cherries emerges in the midpalate, bolstered by some black licorice.",87,22.0,Matt Kettmann,Merlot,Bianchi,2011,Paso Robles,-120.6912456,35.6267654
24,Italy,"Aromas of prune, blackcurrant, toast and oak carry through to the extracted palate, along with flavors of black cherry and roasted coffee beans. Firm but drying tannins provide the framework.",87,35.0,Kerin O’Keefe,Nero d'Avola,Canicattì,2009,Sicilia,14.155048,37.587794
25,US,"Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.",87,69.0,Virginie Boone,Pinot Noir,Castello di Amorosa,2011,Sonoma Coast,-123.007476481926,38.800990549999995
28,Italy,"Aromas suggest mature berry, scorched earth, animal, toast and anise. The palate offers ripe black berry, oak, espresso, cocoa and vanilla alongside dusty tannins.",87,17.0,Kerin O’Keefe,Red Blend,Terre di Giurfo,2011,Cerasuolo di Vittoria,14.5519145,36.9727671
